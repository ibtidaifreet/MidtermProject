  <div class="div-3"><b>What are we forgetting in the midst of forming connections?</b>
    <p id="second phrase"> Most of the closest relationships we form are based out of our early childhood <b> experiences</b></p>
    <p> Some of us maybe had a parent who was <b>never</b> there for us.
    <p> Some of us had a parent who never knew how to comfort us when we needed them for our support.
    <b>What did that result to?</b>
  </div>

  <div class="div-3"><b>We are somehow drawn to the pain that feels familiar and are stuck in...</b>
    <p id="second phrase"> insecure or avoidant attachments.</b></p>
    <p> A lot of us, actually a whopping <b> 40% </b> of us are stuck in a relationship where we hurt more than we love being stuck in such attachments.</p>
    <p> So how do we break ourselves from the shackles of broken connections? </p>
    <b> It starts with you. It starts with how you take charge of your own narrative and reflect.</b>
